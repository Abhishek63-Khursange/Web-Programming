            <h1>Welcome To Home page of Routing</h1>
            <p>Routing in React.js means navigating between different pages or components in a single-page application (SPA) — without reloading the entire page.
👉 In simple words:
Routing lets you change the URL and show different content (components) dynamically, just like navigating between pages in a normal website — but React does it without refreshing the page.</p>
