        <h1>Welcome tho the PRACT-EASY website</h1>
        <p>Pract-Easy is an all-in-one platform designed to guide aspiring software developers through every stage of their learning and career journey. 
            Our website provides a structured roadmap for software development, starting from the basics of programming languages such as Python, Java,
             C++, and JavaScript, and progressing to advanced topics like data structures, algorithms, and system design. Each topic is carefully curated 
             to include comprehensive tutorials, practical examples, and real-world applications to ensure that learners grasp both theoretical and practical concepts. Pract-Easy emphasizes hands-on learning, offering a wide variety of coding challenges, exercises, and mini-projects that allow learners to build and reinforce their skills. For every subject, we provide topic-wise most asked questions, along with detailed explanations, making it easier to prepare for interviews and competitive exams. Our platform also features practice questions sorted by difficulty, helping learners start from fundamentals and gradually advance to complex problems. In addition to programming skills, Pract-Easy covers essential software engineering concepts, including version control with Git, database management with SQL and NoSQL, API development, cloud computing fundamentals, and DevOps practices. To prepare learners for real-world scenarios, we include modules on web development frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js, mobile development with Flutter and Android, and backend technologies like Spring Boot and Django. Pract-Easy also highlights key computer science concepts such as operating systems, networking, and object-oriented programming principles. Each topic includes curated interview questions from top tech companies, ensuring learners are exposed to the type of questions they may face in job interviews. Our website encourages active learning through quizzes, coding contests, and peer discussions, allowing learners to test their knowledge and get immediate feedback. Pract-Easy also provides resources for building a strong portfolio, including project ideas, GitHub best practices, and resume tips. We emphasize learning by doing, with step-by-step guidance on developing mini-projects, full-stack applications, and contributions to open-source repositories. The platform is regularly updated with trending technologies and emerging tools in the software development industry, ensuring learners stay current. Users can track their progress through personalized dashboards, earning badges and certificates as they complete different milestones. Pract-Easy also includes articles and guides on soft skills, problem-solving techniques, and interview strategies to make learners well-rounded professionals. From novice programmers to advanced developers, our roadmap is tailored to accommodate all levels, offering structured pathways that align with career goals. The platform provides detailed explanations of algorithms, data structures, and code optimization techniques to help learners write efficient and maintainable code. Pract-Easy integrates interactive coding environments where learners can practice and debug code directly on the website, eliminating the need for separate IDEs. Our question bank covers a wide range of topics including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. For preparation, 
            learners can access curated lists of top interview questions from companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Infosys.</p>
