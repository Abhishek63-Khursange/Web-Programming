DOM ek programming interface hai jo web pages ko objects ki form me represent karta hai, 
jisse hum JavaScript ke through HTML elements ko access aur manipulate kar sakte hain.

Socho aapke HTML page ke sare elements (like <div>, <p>, <button>) ek tree structure me arranged hai.

Ye tree ko DOM kehte hain.

JavaScript use karke aap is tree ke elements ko read, modify, delete ya naye elements add kar sakte ho.


 DOM Tree Structure Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is DOM example</p>
  </body>
</html>


DOM Tree:

Document
 â””â”€ html
     â””â”€ body
         â”œâ”€ h1 ("Hello World")
         â””â”€ p  ("This is DOM example")
