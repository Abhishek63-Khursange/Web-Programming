üß© Real-Life Based Async JavaScript Questions
1Ô∏è‚É£ Food Order Simulation

Problem:

You order pizza üçï, fries üçü, and a drink ü•§.

Pizza takes 3 sec, fries 2 sec, drink 1 sec to prepare.

Print logs in order of preparation using setTimeout.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Online Bookstore Checkout

Problem:

When a user clicks ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù,

Validate payment (2 sec)

Check inventory (1 sec)

Generate invoice (1.5 sec)

Use asynchronous callbacks to simulate this flow.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Student Marks Report

Problem:

You have an array of students with marks.

After 2 sec, print all students who passed.

After 1 sec, print topper student.

After 1.5 sec, print average marks.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Movie Ticket Booking

Problem:

Check seat availability (1 sec)

Reserve seat (2 sec)

Generate ticket (0.5 sec)

Print messages as each step completes using setTimeout independent.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Social Media Notifications

Problem:

Fetch likes (1 sec)

Fetch comments (2 sec)

Fetch shares (1.5 sec)

Log them asynchronously but independently.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Shopping Cart Discount

Problem:

Array of items with prices.

After 2 sec, apply discount to items > 500

After 1 sec, calculate total amount

After 1.5 sec, print most expensive item.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Bank Transaction Simulator

Problem:

Withdraw money (2 sec)

Check balance (1 sec)

Send transaction receipt (1.5 sec)

Use callbacks/setTimeout to simulate asynchronous bank operations.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Weather Forecast

Problem:

Fetch temperature (1 sec)

Fetch humidity (1.5 sec)

Fetch wind speed (2 sec)

Display all three asynchronously.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Exam Result Publishing

Problem:

Students array ‚Üí marks fetched from server (2 sec)

Identify failed students (1 sec)

Identify topper (1.5 sec)

Use filter, map, reduce + setTimeout to simulate async API.

üîü Online Food Delivery Ratings

Problem:

Fetch restaurant ratings (1 sec)

Fetch user reviews (1.5 sec)

Fetch delivery time (2 sec)

Print independently but asynchronously using arrow functions and setTimeout.

üí° Pro Tips for Solving:

Start by logging normal console messages to see synchronous order.

Wrap each task in a setTimeout() for delays.

Use arrow functions for shorter syntax.

For array problems, combine with filter(), map(), reduce() wherever needed.

Try to predict output before running ‚Äî it helps in interviews.
